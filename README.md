# FUTURE_CS_01
# Vulnerability Assessment of DVWA

## Overview
A security assessment of **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** was conducted using **OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nmap** to identify and mitigate security risks.

## Tools Used
- **OWASP ZAP** – Web application scanning
- **Burp Suite** – Web security testing
- **Nmap** – Network reconnaissance

## Key Findings
- **SQL Injection** – Unauthorized database access
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – JavaScript injection vulnerability
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** – Unauthorized data access
- **Server Misconfiguration** – Information disclosure
- **Weak Authentication** – Lack of MFA and weak passwords

## Recommendations
- **Implement input validation** to prevent SQL injection and XSS
- **Enforce strong authentication** with MFA and password policies
- **Restrict access controls** to prevent unauthorized data access
- **Secure server configurations** by removing unnecessary headers

## Conclusion
Enhancing **input validation, authentication mechanisms, and server security** significantly improves web application security.
